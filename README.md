# Redux Employee Polls Project

Welcome to the redux employee polls project. You can use this project to ask questions to other employees. 
These questions are always defined by two options, which the user can define themselves.

Once you log in, you are able to ask questions, check existing questions and look at the leaderboard.

When you create a new question, you can choose what you wish to ask your colleagues.
Whenever you answer a question, your answer is saved and embedded in the leaderboard.

## TL;DR

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the server with `npm start`
- run jest tests with `npm test`

## How to use
Once you open the application, you are prompted to log in. You can use the some of the following example credentials:

``username: "Sarah Edo",
password: "password123"``

`` 
name: "Tyler McGinnis"
password: "abc321"``

You can find more of these credentials in the `_DATA.JS` file.
